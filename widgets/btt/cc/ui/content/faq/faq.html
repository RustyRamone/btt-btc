                <strong>What do these 11 Chapters cover?</strong>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        These 11 chapters cover <strong>introductory compositional concepts related to Melody, Rhythm and Arrangement</strong>.  The accompanying compositional activities are super fun and engaging. For example in Chapter 1 - you create a melody based on the 1st four letters of your name. In Chapter 4 – you learn to create a Spooky Melody using half notes, and call & response phrasing. Then in Chapter 5 you create a Spoken Chorus (a predecessor to Rap).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Historical context</strong> is also provided in these lessons.  Each chapter highlights a famous composer or musical genre.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students also <strong>learn to use notation and sequencing software</strong> in a progressive fashion, with each chapter building on the other in terms of new techniques being introduced.

                        BT Theory and BT Composing are designed to work hand and hand, and this is a totally unique feature to Breezin’ Thru.  <strong>Breezin’ Thru <em>Theory</em></strong> provides you with a fun way to learn music theory concepts; while <strong>Breezin’ Thru <em>Composing</em></strong> helps apply what you learnt to create your own music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>As an added bonus</strong> each BT Composing chapter highlights a <strong>“theory link”</strong> that is applied to your composition. This mini lesson is a refresher of sorts and gives students enough to get going.  However to build mastery we really encourage students to complete the corresponding chapter in the BT Theory e-binder – the drills are fun, auto-assessed, and take only 2-minutes to complete.

                    <p>
                        Both products are accessed online, BT Theory with a computer and BT Composing on any device. Woohoo – we’ll bring out the music in you!
