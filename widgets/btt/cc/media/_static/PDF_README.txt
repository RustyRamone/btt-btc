PDFs in an iframe do not seem to work on the iPad so they must be converted to
HTML using the following method:

1. Using Preview, crop the PDF document so there are no margins.

2. Upload the PDF to this awesome site - http://www.idrsolutions.com/online-pdf-to-html5-converter/
	
	Config:
		Preset: Only Pages No Viewer
		Fit To Width: 700px

3. Download the resulting zip file and put the resulting folder in this directory.

4. Edit index.html. Change the background to #fff and remove the shadow.
